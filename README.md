The Bankist App is a simple banking web application that allows users to log in, transfer money between accounts, take out loans, and manage account details. This app allows users to track their movements, check their balance, and see summaries of their deposits, withdrawals, and earned interest.

LOGIN:

Enter your username and PIN to log in. Usernames are the first letters of each word in the owner's name (e.g., "Arda Hakan ATAOGLU" becomes "aha").
Click the "Login" button to access your account.

VIEW MOVEMENTS:

After logging in, you will see the list of all your recent transactions (deposits and withdrawals) displayed under "Movements."

TRANSFER MONEY:

To transfer money to another account, enter the recipient's username and the transfer amount. Click the "Transfer" button to complete the transaction.

TAKE A LOAN:

If you need money, you can request a loan by entering the loan amount. The loan is granted if your account history shows that you have made deposits equal to at least 10% of the loan amount.

CLOSE ACCOUNT:

To close your account, enter your username and PIN, and click "Close Account." After a successful account closure, your data is removed from the system.

SORT TRANSACTIONS:

You can toggle the sorting of your transactions by clicking the "Sort" button. This will arrange your transactions in either ascending or descending order.
